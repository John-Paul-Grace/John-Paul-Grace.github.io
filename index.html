                            I am a fledgeling full-stack web developer who has been doing back-end programs for years. I began studying computer science in middle school when I joined an afterschool S.T.E.M. club. We made small programs and robotics with Arduino, and I instantly fell in love with programming. I am fluent in Java, have studied Python, and am currently studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although I wish to become a full-stack developer, my true passion lies in the logical problem-solving of back-end development.

                            As for more personal information, I am currently twenty years-old and live in the town of Highlands, NC. I attended Highlands High School, and, for a time, I studied at UNC-Chapel Hill for a degree in computer science.
