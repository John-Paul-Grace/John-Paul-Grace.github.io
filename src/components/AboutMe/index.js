        I am a full-stack web developer who has been doing back-end programs for years.
        Organization and efficiency are my two strongest attributes.
        My passion is in creating games and tools for people to have fun.
        I am a self-driven leader who is always looking for a new project.
        High stress environments are where I do my best work.

      <p className="text-lg">
        I can contribute to any team with my excellent communication skills and determination to get the job done right.
        I do bug fixes and logic puzzles for fun.
        If you'll have me, I would love to do them for work as well.
